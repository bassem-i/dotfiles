This repo contains the dot configuration files for Git & Zsh.

The goal is to be able to share the files across multiple devices and unify my development experience.

Required steps:

1. Clone the repo into `~/Workspace`.
2. Make sure zsh is your default shell.
3. Install homebrew.
4. Run `init.sh`.
